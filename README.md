This program combines many techniques, such as artificial neural network, reinforcemente learning and minimax with pruning to create an AI chess player.

The code is still incomplete and undergoing many changes.

The file main.py implements the main script, which keeps the game loop (receive and generate input moves from both players).

In the file agent.py, the class mind is defined with an initial chess board that can be used to implement different chess players.

In the file arbiter.py, the class arbiter is defined inheriting the properties of the class mind. The class arbiter is intended to be used in code designed to implement check and checkmate verifications, as well as making the valid moves in the official chess board of the game.

The file random_player.py creates a dumb machine player that selects a move randomly among the possible moves in the turn.

The file train_neural_network.py was used to train a artificial neural network that predicts the score of a move.

The file test_minimax.py was used to test the minimax algorithm with pruning, defined in the agent.py file.

The file learn_valid_moves.py contains code that tries to learn the valid moves of a game based on a batch of moves and games generated by the computer itself.
